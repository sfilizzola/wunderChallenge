# Wunder Challenge 

As part of the test assignment we would like to ask you to build an app which
tackles the everyday problems we face at Wunder. The app should access a
JSON feed of cars:

âž” https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/wunderbucket/locations.json

It should persist them and display the information in two different sections:
Section 1:

Display all the cars information in a list.

Section 2:

Display all the cars in the map (plus the user's updated location).
After tapping a car on the map, the others should disappear and the car name
should be displayed on top of the map pin, tapping again on the car will hide the
car name and show again the other cars' pins.

Technical requirements:

+Kotlin or Java (with Kotlin being preferable)
+minSdkVersion 19
+Any third party library can be used

Keep the UI minimal but straightforward, and do not worry about the design, we
do not have any restrictions here, native UI elements will suffice! If you feel the
need to add some cool features to our small app, feel free to do so.
It will be a big plus if you structure your code using the MVP/MVI/MVVM
pattern, or any other pattern that you find suitable (and let us know why). Unit
tests are welcome but are not mandatory.
When you are ready, please create a repository in Github/Bitbucket, push your
changes into the repository and share it with us. Feel free to contact us with any
questions regarding the assignment or the submission process. We would be
happy to help!
